This folder contains all the project files related to the multichannel optical detector
based on Hamamatsu's G13913-128FB linear image sensor.

Folder STM32_ImageSensor contains the Arduino project files for the STM32 microcontroller. 
Instructions on how to install the required packages and drivers to use STM32 MCU with
tne Arduino IDE are included in the main project file.

Folder PCB_KiCadProject contains the project files for the PCB in which the image sensor 
is mounted and connected to the MCU development board. The gerber files used to
manufacture the first prototype through JLCPCB's services are also included.

Folder ArduinoDue_TestSignals contains the Arduino project file for an ArduinoDue board
to generate test signals for the detection system.

Folder PhotonicImagingApp_Installer contains the installation files for the Windows
Application to control the detection module. The source files for the application
are archived in the VisualStudio_PhotonicImagingAppProject.zip file.
